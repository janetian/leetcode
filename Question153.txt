153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array 

Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.


Answer:

class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) 
    {
        int low = 0;
		int high = nums.size() - 1;
		int mid;
		while (low < high)
		{
			mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
			if (nums[mid] > nums[high]) 
			{
				low = mid + 1;
			}
			else 
			{
				high = mid;
			}
		}
		return nums[low];
    }
};
