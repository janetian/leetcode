374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!

Example:

n = 10, I pick 6.

Return 6.


Answer:

// Forward declaration of guess API.
// @param num, your guess
// @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
int guess(int num);

class Solution 
{
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) 
    {
        int low = 1;
	int high = n;
	int mid;
	while (low <= high)
	{
		//mid = (low + high) / 2;   // Time Limit Exceeded
		mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
		int guess_res = guess(mid);
		if (guess_res == 0)
		{
			return mid;
		}
		else if (guess_res == -1) // guess number > computer number(target)
		{
			high = mid - 1;
		}
		else if (guess_res == 1)  // guess number < computer number(target) 
		{
			low = mid + 1;
		}	
	}
	return -1;
    }
};
